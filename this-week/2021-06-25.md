## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [753](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/753): (77/136) workload-partitioning: add plan for configuration and enablement ownership (dhellmann)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The initial iteration of workload partitioning focused on a short path
  > to a minimum viable implementation. This enhancement describes the
  > loose ends for preparing the feature for GA at a high level, and
  > explains the set of other design documents that need to be written
  > separately during the next iteration.

- [804](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/804): (11/28) workload-partitioning: PAO render initial draft (MarSik)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, priority/important-soon`

  > The Performance addon operator is a day 2 optional operator installed via OLM. However the [Workload partitioning](management-workload-partitioning.md) feature needs to have some configuration ready at the installation time when PAO is not yet ready.
  > This feature is about adding a `render` mode to PAO that would allow an admin to pre-compute all the Openshift manifests that are needed in a way that prevents any typing mistakes from happening.
  > These generated manifests can then be passed to the installer and later taken over by the PAO reconcile loop.

- [802](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/802): (6/37) workload-partitioning: WIP Workload partitioning API enhancement (MarSik)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, priority/important-soon`

  > The overall feature summary is present in the [Management workload partitioning](workload-partitioning/management-workload-partitioning.md) feature. This document focuses on how the feature enablement API and its interactions will look like.

## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other Merged pull requests:

- [564](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/564): (9/27) cluster-logging: Allowing users to specify a delete policy based on amount of storage used within the ES cluster (ewolinetz)

  > Currently our index management within OpenShift Elasticsearch is limited to just being time based for rollover and deletion. The goal of this proposal is to introduce and outline extending this to also include amount of storage used. There are a two different ways this can be measured within an ES cluster such as per index and per node -- this proposal will also discuss the differences.

- [642](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/642): (5/53) kubelet: Auto Node Sizing (harche)

  > Nodes should have an automatic sizing calculation mechanism, which could give kubelet an ability to scale values for memory and cpu system reserved based on machine size.
  >
  > Today the sizing values are passed manually to kubelet using `--kube-reserved` and `--system-reserved` flags. Many cloud providers provide reference values for their customers to help them select optimal values based on the node sizes. e.g. [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture#memory_cpu),
  > [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#resource-reservations)
  >
  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism to automatically determine the optimal sizing values for any node size irrespective of the cloud provider.

- [786](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/786): (62/315) dns: Add ExternalDNS Operator Enhancement Proposal (sgreene570)

  > This enhancement proposal is for adding an operator to manage
  > [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns). ExternalDNS has been chosen for managing external DNS
  > requirements of OpenShift clusters. Initially, the operator will focus on managing external DNS records for OpenShift
  > [Routes](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/master/route/v1/types.go), in addition to Kubernetes Services.
  > Additionally, a new ExternalDNS operator CRD will be used to initially expose limited ExternalDNS configuration capabilities.
  >
  > Existing operators will be used to guide the design of the ExternalDNS operator. Tooling will be
  > included to make it easy to build, run, test, etc. the operator for OpenShift, and for vanilla Kubernetes.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other New pull requests:

- [811](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/811): (2/2) network: Enhancement proposal for OVN secondary networks (maiqueb)

  > This enhacement proposal studies and describes how to support OVN as the
  > networking provider for a Multus secondary interface.

- [812](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/812): (42/42) node: Add proposal about Node Operator (saschagrunert)

  > The overall goal of creating this new operator in OpenShift is the encapsulation
  > of CRI-O and kubelet related configurations, metrics and alerts within a single
  > domain and namespace.This provides on one hand a higher flexibility for the Node
  > team, while on the other hand the dependency on external teams gets reduced. In
  > the long-term the Node team would only rely on OpenShift internal APIs to manage
  > the container runtime and kubelet related configurations. Additional deployments
  > for proxying runtime metrics or providing telemetry access are part of this
  > operator, too.

- [813](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/813): (3/3) dns: Update ExternalDNS Operator Enhancement (sgreene570)

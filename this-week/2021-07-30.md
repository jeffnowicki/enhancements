- [828](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/828): (22/181) update: Add admin ack upgrade gate (jottofar)

  > CVO currently blocks minor level upgrades when overrides are set, a resource deletion is pending, or an operator has set its upgradeable condition to false.
  > This enhancement adds a generic upgrade blocking mechanism for blocking minor level upgrades.
  > This generic upgrade blocker can consist of one or more items each of which will block a minor level upgrade.
  > Each generic upgrade blocker item will be associated with some well-defined task to be completed by an administrator.
  > Once the task has been completed the administrator will acknowledge completion and its associated item will no longer block minor level upgrades.

- [695](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/695): (5/31) dev-guide: move CVO upgrades doc to enhancements (deads2k)

  > Moves CVO docs to enhancements.  The tombstone in the original location is here: https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/pull/631 .  These docs cover integration with other components, what those components need to do to participate, what impact they have on each other, and how a cluster upgrades.

- [826](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/826): (2/52) cluster-logging: Creating initial skeleton of eo v2 api proposal (ewolinetz)

  > Currently when interacting with the Elasticsearch Operator via the Elasticsearch CRD, one needs to have a lot of knowledge on how to best configure
  > the Elasticsearch cluster node's roles, memory/cpu, and replication count. We improve the user experience of the operator, and provide a more performant
  > cluster that can operate at scale, by both simplifying the API and moving the knowledge of the desired infrastructure into the operator itself.

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [753](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/753): (20/24) workload-partitioning: add plan for configuration and enablement ownership (dhellmann)

  > The initial iteration of workload partitioning focused on a short path
  > to a minimum viable implementation. This enhancement describes the
  > loose ends for preparing the feature for GA at a high level, and
  > explains the set of other design documents that need to be written
  > separately during the next iteration.

- [744](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/744): (12/62) general: External control plane topology (csrwng)

  > External control plane support was introduced in OCP 4 with the support
  > for the [IBM Cloud Managed service](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/update/ibm-public-cloud-support.md) (ROKS). At the time, this was the only platform that
  > was run with an external control plane. It was sufficient to use a platform type of
  > `IBMCloud` to distinguish it from other OCP installations with traditional
  > control plane topology.
  >
  > More recently, an orthogonal field was [added to the Infrastructure resource](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/single-node/cluster-high-availability-mode-api.md) to indicate
  > the type of control plane topology. Current supported values for the `controlPlaneTopology` field
  > are `HighlyAvailable` and `SingleReplica`.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes adding a third possible value to the control plane topology
  > field: `External`. A value of `External` in this field indicates that control plane components
  > such as Etcd, Kube API server, Kube Controller Manager, and Kube Scheduler are running outside
  > the cluster and are not visible as pods inside the cluster.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other Merged pull requests:

- [647](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/647): (2/65) windows-containers: WINC-544: Enhancement proposal for monitoring Windows Nodes (VaishnaviHire)

  > The intent of this enhancement is to enable performance monitoring on Windows
  > nodes created by Windows Machine Config Operator(WMCO) in OpenShift cluster.

- [712](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/712): (5/174) cluster-logging: [cluster-logging] Add proposal for loki as an alternative log store (periklis)

  > The purpose of this is to provide an alternative low-retention log store based on [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) for the cluster logging stack. This aims to provide a cloud-native first solution specialized in storing logs and in turn lessen the operational cost running cluster logging.

- [764](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/764): (2/22) kube-apiserver: removed api notifications (deads2k)

  > Notify customers that an API that will be removed in the next release is in use.


#### Other Merged Pull Requests Modifying Existing Documents

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other New pull requests:

- [771](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/771): (4/4) update: add eus MCO enhancement (rphillips)

  > This enhancement outlines the Machine Config Operator (MCO) behavior when
  > propogating Kubernetes Events in EUS upgrade scenarios.  The MCO will emit
  > events that are user readable and be clear enough that a user can take an
  > action.
  >
  > Related to [Enhancement 762](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/762).

- [775](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/775): (1/1) network: Drop Node Hostname Resolution (cybertron)

  > When the initial baremetal IPI implementation was done, there was a requirement
  > for node hostnames to be resolvable from other nodes. Since that time there
  > have been changes in how bootstrapping happens (among other things) that seem
  > to have removed this requirement. In order to provide node name resolution,
  > baremetal IPI runs an independent coredns pod on each node that retrieves a
  > list of nodes and provides DNS records for them. Some deployments, particularly
  > resource-limited edge environments, do not want this additional service running
  > on their nodes. We are proposing to remove the requirement for node hostnames
  > to be resolvable so we can remove this service.

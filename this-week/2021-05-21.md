# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-05-21

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [744](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/744): (3/64) general: External control plane topology (csrwng)

  > External control plane support was introduced in OCP 4 with the support
  > for the [IBM Cloud Managed service](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/update/ibm-public-cloud-support.md) (ROKS). At the time, this was the only platform that
  > was run with an external control plane. It was sufficient to use a platform type of
  > `IBMCloud` to distinguish it from other OCP installations with traditional
  > control plane topology.
  >
  > More recently, an orthogonal field was [added to the Infrastructure resource](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/single-node/cluster-high-availability-mode-api.md) to indicate
  > the type of control plane topology. Current supported values for the `controlPlaneTopology` field
  > are `HighlyAvailable` and `SingleReplica`.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes adding a third possible value to the control plane topology
  > field: `External`. A value of `External` in this field indicates that control plane components
  > such as Etcd, Kube API server, Kube Controller Manager, and Kube Scheduler are running outside
  > the cluster and are not visible as pods inside the cluster.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other New pull requests:

- [784](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/784): (44/44) installer: Allow installer to include/exclude components based on user select install solution (bparees)

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism for cluster installers to exclude one or more optional components for
  > their installation which will determine which payload components are/are not installed in their cluster.
  > Core components are defined as the set of Second Level Operators managed by the Cluster Version Operator
  > which today cannot be disabled until after completing the install and editing a CVO override, or editing
  > the CVO overrides as part of rendering+editing manifests.
  >
  > The proposed UX is to make this a first class part of the install config api with the implementation
  > being arguments supplied to the CVO to filter the user-selected manifests.

# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-07-09

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [463](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/463): (5/624) machine-api: Describing steps to support out-of-tree providers (Danil-Grigorev)

  `approved, do-not-merge/hold, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposal describes the migration of cloud platforms from the [deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/222cae36ec667c2f12c8aaa73a86e3cf01d80f7e/cmd/kubelet/app/options/options.go#L389) [in-tree cloud providers](https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/)
  > to [Cloud Controller Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/) services that implement the`external cloud provider` [interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider/blob/master/cloud.go).

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (3/135) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

- [643](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/643): (1/66) update: Add Reduced Reboots enhancement (sdodson)

  `lifecycle/stale, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement is intended to reduce host reboots when upgrading across two or
  > more OpenShift minor versions by enabling an N-2 version skew policy between all
  > host components and cluster scoped resources.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [690](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/690): (15/70) api-review: Add repositoryMirrors spec to ImageContentSourcePolicy (QiWang19)

  > Today, the ImageContentSourcePolicy object sets up mirror with `mirror-by-digest-only` property set to true. Requires images be pulled by digest only. This enhancement plans to add new spec to ImageContentSourcePolicy with configurable field `allowMirrorByTags`, so that `mirror-by-digest-only` can be configured by ImageContentSourcePolicy.

- [701](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/701): (110/394) monitoring: metrics scraping with local authentication and authorization (deads2k)

  > Monitoring needs to be reliable and is the very useful when trying to debug clusters in an already degraded state.
  > We want to ensure that metrics scraping can always work if the scraper can reach the target, even if the kube-apiserver
  > is unavailable or unreachable.
  > To do this, we will combine a local authorizer (already merged in many binaries and the rbac-proxy) and client-cert based
  > authentication to have a fully local authentication and authorization path for scraper targets.

- [793](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/793): (4/116) authentication: describe group syncing for OIDC identity providers (stlaz)

  > OpenShift should be capable of synchronizing user groups from a 3rd party
  > identity provider upon a user logging in to their OpenShift cluster.


### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other New pull requests:

- [826](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/826): (30/30) cluster-logging: Creating initial skeleton of eo v2 api proposal (ewolinetz)

  `approved, do-not-merge/hold`

  > Currently when interacting with the Elasticsearch Operator via the Elasticsearch CRD, one needs to have a lot of knowledge on how to best configure
  > the Elasticsearch cluster node's roles, memory/cpu, and replication count. In order to continue to improve the user experience of the operator
  > and provide a performant cluster that can operate at scale we should simplify the API and move the knowledge of desired infrastructure into the
  > operator itself.

- [827](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/827): (7/7) machine-api: Backport the `pause` feature for MachineHealthChecks (slintes)

  > Enable opt in for automated health checking and remediation of unhealthy nodes backed by machines. a.k.a. node auto repair.

- [828](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/828): (3/3) update: Bug 1978376: Add ack based upgrade blocker (jottofar)

  `bugzilla/severity-urgent, bugzilla/valid-bug, do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > CVO currently blocks minor level upgrades when overrides are set, a resource deletion is pending, or an operator has set its upgradeable condition to false.
  > This enhancement adds a generic upgrade blocking mechanism for blocking minor level upgrades.
  > This generic upgrade blocker can consist of one or more items each of which will block a minor level upgrade.
  > Each generic upgrade blocker item will be associated with some well-defined task to be completed by an administrator.
  > Once the task has been completed the administrator will acknowledge completion and its associated item will no longer block minor level upgrades.

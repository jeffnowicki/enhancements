### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [830](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/830): (130/148) disaster-recovery: WIP Add enhancement for automated cluster backups (marun)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, priority/important-soon`

  > Enable the configuration of automated backup of etcd and the static pod
  > content that underpin an OpenShift 4.x self-hosted cluster.

- [828](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/828): (66/160) update: Add admin ack upgrade gate (jottofar)

  `priority/critical-urgent`

  > CVO currently blocks minor level upgrades when overrides are set, a resource deletion is pending, or an operator has set its upgradeable condition to false.
  > This enhancement adds a generic upgrade blocking mechanism for blocking minor level upgrades.
  > This generic upgrade blocker can consist of one or more items each of which will block a minor level upgrade.
  > Each generic upgrade blocker item will be associated with some well-defined task to be completed by an administrator.
  > Once the task has been completed the administrator will acknowledge completion and its associated item will no longer block minor level upgrades.

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (1/136) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other Merged pull requests:

- [460](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/460): (3/22) ingress: Add empty-requests-policy enhancement (Miciah)

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API to allow the user to
  > configure IngressControllers to log or ignore "empty requests", meaning
  > incoming connections on which the IngressController receives no requests.

- [749](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/749): (2/184) ingress: NE-310 Enhancement proposal for HSTS route admission plugin (candita)

  > [NE-310](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-310) enhancement proposal supersedes previous [NE-310](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-310) enhancement proposal: https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/ingress/global-options-enable-hsts.md

- [816](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/816): (17/39) ingress: Ingress: Add API for configuring ingress connection timeouts (rfredette)

  > This document proposes the addition of several API fields into the ingress
  > controller API, allowing the cluster admin to adjust how long routers will hold
  > open connections under various circumstances.

- [833](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/833): (12/34) kube-apiserver: Fallback on Failing Revisions of Static Pods (sttts)

  > Static pods operators use a revisioned pod manifest and revisioned configmap and secret manifests to roll out and start a new configuration of the operand in an atomic way.
  >
  > Configuration can be bad in different ways. In HA OpenShift, the static pod operator will wait for operands on one node to start up and to become healthy and ready. The operator will stop rolling out bad revisions further.
  >
  > In SNO, there is no other pod to ensure availability when a roll-out of a new revision happens. Hence, a bad revision can be fatal for the cluster, especially for the kube-apiserver and etcd.
  >
  > This enhancement is describing a fallback mechanism that will make the operand to revert to the last healthy revision when the new revision fails, and how the operator will notice this event and how it will react.
  >
  > The fallback mechanism is opt-in by the operator, and kube-apiserver and etcd operators (and potentially kcm and ks) have to consult the deployment topology in the infrastructure resource to decide. Most of the text here is generic, but we will focus mainly on the cluster-kube-apiserver-operator use-case first.

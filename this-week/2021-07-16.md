- [463](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/463): (32/656) machine-api: Describing steps to support out-of-tree providers (Danil-Grigorev)

  > This enhancement proposal describes the migration of cloud platforms from the [deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/222cae36ec667c2f12c8aaa73a86e3cf01d80f7e/cmd/kubelet/app/options/options.go#L389) [in-tree cloud providers](https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/)
  > to [Cloud Controller Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/) services that implement the`external cloud provider` [interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider/blob/master/cloud.go).


### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [830](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/830): (18/18) disaster-recovery: WIP Add enhancement for automated cluster backups (marun)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, priority/important-soon`

  > Enable the configuration of automated cluster backups.


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [828](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/828): (93/95) update: Add admin ack upgrade gate (jottofar)

  `priority/critical-urgent`

  > CVO currently blocks minor level upgrades when overrides are set, a resource deletion is pending, or an operator has set its upgradeable condition to false.
  > This enhancement adds a generic upgrade blocking mechanism for blocking minor level upgrades.
  > This generic upgrade blocker can consist of one or more items each of which will block a minor level upgrade.
  > Each generic upgrade blocker item will be associated with some well-defined task to be completed by an administrator.
  > Once the task has been completed the administrator will acknowledge completion and its associated item will no longer block minor level upgrades.

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [709](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/709): (2/90) installer: Add proposal for credentials management outside the openshift cluster for new platforms (akhil-rane)

  > The intent of this enhancement is to take the process of credentials management outside the OpenShift cluster for new
  > platforms. We propose to make *manual* mode as default for clusters on new platforms, optionally supported by CLI tooling
  > that follows the best practices of the hosting infrastructure at that time.


#### Other Merged Pull Requests Modifying Existing Documents

- [823](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/823): (13/14) cluster-logging: Remove tenant configuration from loki output configuration. (alanconway)
- [824](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/824): (2/4) authentication: auth: add sur and stlaz to group sync approvers (stlaz)

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other New pull requests:

- [831](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/831): (5/5) single-node: WIP - aos-sno-pair enhancement (mshitrit)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement describes setting up a two nodes cluster with a reduced footprint which will serve edge cases.

- [833](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/833): (23/23) kube-apiserver: Fallback on Failing Revisions of Static Pods (sttts)

  > Static pods operators use a revisioned pod manifest and revisioned configmap and secret manifests to roll out and start a new configuration of the operand in an atomic way.
  >
  > Configuration can be bad in different ways. In HA OpenShift, the static pod operator will wait for operands on one node to start up and to become healthy and ready. The operator will stop rolling out bad revisions further.
  >
  > In SNO, there is no other pod to ensure availability when a roll-out of a new revision happens. Hence, a bad revision can be fatal for the cluster, especially for the kube-apiserver and etcd.
  >
  > This enhancement is describing a fallback mechanism that will make the operand to revert to the last healthy revision when the new revision fails, and how the operator will notice this event and how it will react.
  >
  > The fallback mechanism is opt-in by the operator, and kube-apiserver and etcd operators (and potentially kcm and ks) have to consult the deployment topology in the infrastructure resource to decide. Most of the text here is generic, but we will focus mainly on the cluster-kube-apiserver-operator use-case first.

- [834](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/834): (75/75) machine-api: Propose new controller for pausing MHC during cluster upgrades (slintes)

  > Automatically prevent unwanted remediation during cluster upgrades caused by temporarily unhealthy nodes.

- [836](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/836): (13/13) etcd: ETCD-58: WIP Add enhancement for automated defragmentation (hexfusion)

  > Enable automated defragmentation of the etcd cluster state.

- [837](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/837): (2/2) insights: Conditional Data Gathering for Insights Operator (Sergey1011010)

  > The conditional gatherer for Insights Operator collects data according to the defined rules*.
  > Each rule contains one or more conditions such as "alert A is firing"
  > and one or more gatherers with parameters such as "collect N lines of logs from containers in namespace N".
  > Current version has these rules defined in the code and the proposal is to load them from an external source
  > to make collection of new conditional data faster. It's NOT about running brand new code,
  > but just calling the existing gatherers with different validated parameters, so the operator can't
  > collect anything we don't expect.
  >
  > \* note that rule here and later has nothing to do with rules used to analyze data in archives written
  > by CCX presentation team
